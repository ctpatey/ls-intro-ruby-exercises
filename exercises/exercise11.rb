# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

# I've enjoyed using ruby-doc.org for it's simple and easy to use interface and I can even dive into the source code written in C if I want, which is fun.

# I dove into rubygems.org and attempted to learn a bit about the rubygems API. It looks like I can download a program that helps me manage my rubygems. Overall I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at.
