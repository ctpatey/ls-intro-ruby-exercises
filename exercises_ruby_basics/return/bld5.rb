# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

# I think this will print "Dinner" and then nothing. OK so i was wrong, I should have gone with my first thought which is that "Dinner" will get printed and then "nil". "Nil" because that is what puts returns and the puts statement is the last line of the method.
