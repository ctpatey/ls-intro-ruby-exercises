# What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(b)
  b = a + a
end

my_value(a)
puts a

# 7. Ok I was impulsive and guessed 7. I knew that my_value method didn't have access to a, but I'm frustrated that I got parts 4 and 5 wrong, so I became impatient.
