# Lets move on now to the documentation you will use most often; the core API section on Classes and Modules. All of these are listed under Classes on the Core API page.

# Locate and open the class documentation for the String class.

# Found it. It was a little difficult finding it on docs.ruby-lang.org At this point I'm not sure why docs.ruby-lang.org is prefered over ruby-doc.org. I usually use the search function chrome provides to find text quickly, but when I searched for 'string' there were over 300 results on Docs.ruby-lang.org after clicking on 'classes' from the home page.
