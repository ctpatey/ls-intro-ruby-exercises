# Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a way that makes them easier to read.

# I navigated to the 'pages' page of the documentation and saw that there was a 'numbers' link. I clicked on it and discovered that you can write numbers in ruby like so: 1_999_098, which is the number 1999098 in a easier to understand format.
