# Below we have given you an array and a number. Write a program that checks to see if the number appears in the array.

arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
number = 3

puts arr.include?(number)

# .include evaluates to true or false and will let us know if the agrument is in the arr variable. Should I be verbose like the given answers are?
