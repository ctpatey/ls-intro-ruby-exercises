# How do you return the word "example" from the following array?

arr = [["test", "hello", "world"],["example", "mem"]]

p arr[1][0]

# The given solution is arr.last.first. After testing my method words as well. I'm not sure which one is better in terms of efficiecy though. arr.last.first is more readable.
