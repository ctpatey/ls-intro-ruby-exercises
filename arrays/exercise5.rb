# What is the value of a, b, and c in the following program?

string = "Welcome to America!"
puts a = string[6]
puts b = string[11]
puts c = string[19]

# I was about to manually count out the indices for a, b, and c, but that seemed really dumb.

# value of a is 'e'
# value of b is 'A'
# value of c is ' '

# Ok well in the given answer c = nil but you asked for the value. The value is ' ', but the return value is nil. Usually you specifically ask for the return value if that's what you want. In This case you just asked for the value. Maybe I'm missing something there.
