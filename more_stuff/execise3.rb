# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

#  Exception handling is something that someone coded to give us a stack trace to give us a way to find the problems in our code.

# The answer is: Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program. It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.

# OK, so now I know better. The example is Begin/Rescue/End structure.
